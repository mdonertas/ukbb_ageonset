## processed/traits_clean/SRDisease_baseline(.rds|.tsv)

* Generated by ./scripts/03-prepTraitData.R
* Includes the following information for 362,772 samples that passed the QC and has at least one disease (note that the number of entries (904,035) is higher than the number of samples as one sample can have more than one disease).

## processed/traits_clean/SRcancer_baseline(.rds|.tsv)

* Generated by ./scripts/03-prepTraitData.R
* Includes the following information for 39,910 samples that passed the QC and has at least one disease (note that the number of entries (42,852) is higher than the number of samples as one sample can have more than one type of cancer).

## processed/traits_clean/SRDisease_baseline_propagated.rds

* Generated by ./scripts/03-prepTraitData.R
* The self-reported diseases in UK Biobank are not independent, but rather are organized in a hierarchical manner. Using the relationship information between diseases, we propagate disease-participant associations. For example, if a person reports having “essential hypertension”, we also annotate that person with “hypertension”, and “cardiovascular disease”.
* Includes the following information for 362,772 samples that passed the QC and has at least one disease (note that the number of entries (2,242,698) is higher than the number of samples as one sample can have more than one disease).

```{r}

[7] "Age"
```
* Age: Using the minimum age at diagnosis for all the diseases that are child term for a particular disease, we re-defined age at diagnosis information.

* nSRdisease: The number of unique self-reported non-cancer illnesses each participant informed in the baseline recruitment. 
* nSRdiseaseProp: The number of unique self-reported diseases each participant has after the data propagation.
* nSRcancer: The number of unique self-reported cancers each participant informed in the baseline recruitment.
* BMI: Using the columns for ‘Weight’ and ‘Standing height’ we calculated BMI based on the following formula: “Weight / (Standing Height / 100)^2”
* Parent Min Age at Death: The age at which the first deceased parent died. If none of the parents died, or if the data is unavailable, this column is set to be NA. If only one parent died, we use the corresponding age as the minimum. 
* Parent Max Age at Death: The age at which the second deceased parent died. If none of the parents died, or if the data is unavailable, this column is set to be NA. If only one parent died, we use the corresponding age as the maximum. 
* Parent Avg Age at Death: The age at which the first deceased parent died. If none of the parents died, or if the data is unavailable, this column is set to be NA. If only one parent died, we use the corresponding age as the average.
