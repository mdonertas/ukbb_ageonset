# The link between ageing and ageing-related diseases

## Question
What is the link between ageing and ageing-related diseases (ARDs)?

## Approach 1: Disease Case-Control Studies

**Questions**

1. Are there common genetic components across ARDs?
2. Are they distinct / in common with the early onset or developmental diseases?
    * if in common: same or opposite direction?

## Approach 2: Disease Age of Onset

**Questions**

1. What determines disease age-of-onset?
2. Are there common genetic components across diseases?
3. Any overlap with the common genetic component across ARDs?

## Downstream : How these relate to ageing?

1. Ageing pathways
2. Hallmarks of ageing
3. Ageing genes (GenAge-like, expression)
4. Healthy people but with variant:
	* Health measures in UKBB
	* Epigenetic Age

## Data
