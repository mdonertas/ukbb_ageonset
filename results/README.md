## SampleQC/Overlap_ExcCat

* Generated by ./scripts/02-UKBB_sampleQC.R
* Plot shows the percent overlap between the exclusions based on different criteria. This is after removal of withdrawn samples and samples without genotypes. 

## SampleQC/Overlap_ExcCat_Heatmap

* Generated by ./scripts/02-UKBB_sampleQC.R
* Plot shows the percent overlap between the exclusions based on different criteria. This is after removal of withdrawn samples and samples without genotypes. 
* A heatmap showing the overlap between exclusions based on different criteria. Values show the percent of the column in the row, e.g. 19.4% of “Rec. Exclusions” are in “Hetero / missing outliers” i) “Hetero / missing outliers”: ‘22027-0.0’ (Outliers for heterozygosity or missing rate), ii) “Rec. Exclusions”: field ‘22010-0.0’ (Recommended genomic analysis exclusions), iii) “High hetero / missing”: ‘22018-0.0’, High heterozygosity rate (after correcting for ancestry) or high missing rate, iv) “Mixed Ancestry”: ‘22018-0.0’, Participant self-declared as having a mixed ancestral background, and v) “Discordant Sex”: as described in the sample QC methods. 

## SampleQC/Het_Miss_Plots

* Generated by ./scripts/02-UKBB_sampleQC.R
* A scatter plot between logit(Missingness) and Heterozygosity for each Ethnic background, defined in UK Biobank. Samples to be excluded are shown as darker points.
